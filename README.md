# Anthill-ia-unity
An ant simulation for unity 2D

## IA rules 
- Random movement while searching food (epxressed by the `foundFood` variable)
- When it found food, it register the food location and bring back the piece of food to the anthill 
- For each collision with the others ants, they're informed of the food location
